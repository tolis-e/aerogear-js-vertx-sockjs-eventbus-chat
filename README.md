# aerogear-js-vertx-sockjs-eventbus-chat
> Sample example which uses the [AeroGear JS](https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-js) Vert.x Notifier

## Getting Started

Execute: `./vertxbustest/server.sh`

Open the `aerogear-chat/index.html` in multiple tabs of your web browser and exchange messages.

You can stop the server by executing: `./vertxbustest/server.sh stop`

## Notes
The client side part is based on the chat example included in the [stomp-websockets](https://github.com/hornetq/hornetq/tree/master/examples/jms/stomp-websockets) HornetQ examples and has been modified to use the AeroGear Vert.x Notifier.
